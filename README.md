<p> Image Manipulation </p>
<img src="IMG_1346.JPG" width= "500" height= "400" /> 
<img src="Rachel and Mack filtered.jpg" width= "500" height= "400" />
<p> This photo started off a little too dark due to the shadows within, so I adjusted the 
image with the use of Pixlr. I adjusted the brightness on the photo to +10 and the 
contrast by +30 in order to balance it out. In addition to this I also added a vignette to
the photo in order to create a cool filter to the image. </p>

<img src="Snow Dog image crop.jpg" width= "400" height= "500" />
<p> In this image I applied the use of the crop tool in 'GIMP' to remove the unneeded 
aspects in the photo- the dirt and the grass visible in the snow but also to concentrate
on the focus of the image which is my dog. </p>

<img src="945433_101517500030_1589154299_n.jpg" width= "500" height= "400" />
<p> In this image, because it is a picture of a sunset I tried to concentrate the warm 
colours that are evident in it. I changed the colour levels through the use of 'GIMP',
using the red colour to a high level (+40) and the blue to a lower level (-15). I also 
adjusted the contrast in order to concentrate on the warmer reds and pinks emitted from
the sun and darkened the trees, creating a interesting effect onto the image, especially 
exaggerating the sun. </p>

<img src="bikesposterized.jpg" width= "500" hieght= "400" />
<p> This picture had a bit going on so to adjust it I just changed the colour balances, 
the mid tones red +10 and the green by -5. I also used the tool colour curves to manipulate
the colour balance, and to finish it off I posterized the image by +10. The finished 
project did not look dramatically different than the one I began with, but ending up looking
very tampered with but with a interesting looking finish. </p>

<img src="family b and w.jpg" width= "500" hieght= "400" />
<p> I applied a black and white finish to this photo to change it. I used Pixlr to adjust 
the saturation to change the image to remove the colouring and make the image 
black and white. </p>



<img src= "IMG_1304.jpg" width= "400" hieght= "500" />
<img src= "jack on couch.jpg" width= "400" hieght= "500" />
<p> This image I edited with 'GIMP', I started by flipping it horizontally, then creating 
a sepia filter on it to changed the colouring and bringing a warmth to the photo. I then 
adjusted the scanliness to +60. </p>

<img src="10635981_10152877427415030_7014060788766261114_n.jpg" width= "500" hieght= "500" />
<p> This image of my dogs I edited with a iphone app just because I was curious on how it 
would compare to the apps used on my laptop. It compared pretty similarly, as it was able 
to achieve the same effects as the laptop could. I used a app called 'photo editor' by 
Axiem systems, and applied a border, and a filter to emphasize the colours portrayed by
the image. </p>

<p> With this image I got a little more adventurous with 'GIMP' and used the 'lasso' tool
to locate the background of this photo of me with a friend, and then the paint bucket tool
to fill in the photo background with a fun pattern available in gimp. This was a little 
more difficult compared to the other edits I had done, especially getting the hang of the 
lasso tool, but it was also very fun to do. </p>


<p> Copyright Infringement: Assignment #2</p> <bold>

<P> Al Jolson's recording of his popular song "April Showers" is no longer protected under 
its old copyright act as the singer died in 1950 and the writer of the music Louis Silver
died in the year 1954. Therefore this production was protected under the 70 year act but
no longer under the 50 year act. </p>

<p> Copyright Agreements </p>

	<p>	Fair use agreements in the modern age should allow for equal privileges for both the
 product holder and for the user. When it comes to musical rights the owner can hold the 
 rights and then choose how to distribute the songs however they please. Each country 
 should hold their own laws upon copyrights in order to prevent illegal trading of the 
 products within the country and in order that they can enforce their own rules and 
 punishments based on their own laws on copyrights that protect their own artists and other
 artists whose products are distributed.</p>
 
 
	<p>Copyright laws are put in place and used in effort to protect the artist and their
mind that created their own pieces of work. Based on the site copyright.com, which states 
'Copyright protection exists from the moment a work is created in a fixed, tangible form of
expression. The copyright immediately becomes the property of the author who created the
work' (www.copyright.com). Due to this right the author then has the freedom to distribute
what they legally own the rights to in whichever for they see fit. In our modern day and 
age with technology where it is it is more difficult for artists to protect their work,
as it is increasingly easier for people to illegally obtain items by downloading them
off the Internet and use them for their own personal use and even claim them as their
own. The copyright holder should have the freedom based on the copyright laws to make their 
own decision on how they choose to distribute their property and also how to protect and 
ensure that it does actually get distributed to the public.</p>
	
	<p> As part of the new laws passed in Canadian laws under the federal Copyright 
Modernization Act on January 1st, 2015 which 'require[ed] Internet service providers(ISPs)
and website hosts to relay letters from copyright holders to customers associated with the
unique Internet Protocol (IP) address where the illegal downloading is alleged to have 
occurred.' (ctvnews.ca). Under this act the citizens that proceed to illegally download 
can be punished by the copyright holder's discretion for up to five thousand Canadian 
dollars if such download is used for personal use and for up to twenty thousand Canadian 
if the download is used for their own commercial gain. This essentially entails the copy-
right holder holds all of the power to make the decisions on if they choose to punish 
someone for using their product rights or not to. This is one law that could probably be 
changed. The choice to charge and punish someone or not shouldn't be only up to the holder
and the decision should be based on a level of discipline. If the product is used for 
personal use only it shouldn't be able to be punished and charged to the same level as
someone who is profiting by using illegally stolen product. </p>

	<p> The laws created are to protect peoples rights to hold rights to their own bodies 
of work, which is many of their careers and livelihood. All creations should be able to 
be seen and appreciated if the author chooses to share their gift. The timeline on the 
copyrights work well in the sense in that when their timeline is run up the art becomes 
easier to access and due to this their product comes back to life and into the hands of
users therefore keeping the artists and their work evident decades later after its 
release. </p>
